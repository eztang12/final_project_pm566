# Race, Age, and Diagnosis Stage in Breast Cancer Mortality

This project aims to address the question if race affects the age of diagnosis for breast cancer, and if the effects of age and diagnosis stage on vital status differ by race. Breast cancer is the most common malignant cancer in the world for those assigned female at birth. Previous research shows that breast cancer incidence increases with age, but those who are diagnosed at younger ages also have higher reported mortality rates. Previous studies have also shown that race may be a risk factor for breast cancer, and women of color are also associated with getting breast cancer diagnoses at later stages than white women. Understanding differences between the clinical progression of breast cancer across these risk factors can contribute to more nuanced care that can potentially bridge inequities in survivability.
