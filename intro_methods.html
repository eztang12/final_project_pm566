<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common malignant cancer in the world for
women with over one million cases being diagnosed annually (Wang 2017).
Although mortality rates for breast cancer are lower in the United
States and Asia, other countries have unfortunately not seen the same
trend, emphasizing the urgency of studying breast cancer and its
associated risk factors (Azamjah et al. 2019). Like other cancers,
breast cancer incidence increases with age with women above 50 years old
being more likely to develop breast cancer than younger women. On the
other hand, however, previous research has demonstrated that those who
receive breast cancer diagnoses at younger ages also have higher
reported mortality rates than those who are diagnosed later (McGuire et
al., 2015). Previous studies have also shown that race may be a risk
factor for breast cancer, as many women of color have higher mortality
rates than non-Hispanic white women. Women of color, particularly Black
and Native American women, are also associated with getting breast
cancer diagnoses at later stages than white women, indicating that stage
can confound the relationship between race and survival status (Ooi et
al. 2011). Furthermore, women of color are less likely to have access to
liquid biopsies as diagnosis methods, which have been seen to be
associated with better survival outcomes compared to traditional
diagnosis methods (Kim et al. 2017). Given that age and race are two
risk factors, there is limited research done on how age at diagnosis can
<em>interact</em> with stage of diagnosis and race specifically in
breast cancer diagnosis, and how that in turn can contribute to and
exacerbate these differences in mortality rates. Understanding
differences between the clinical progression of breast cancer across
these risk factors can contribute to more nuanced care that can
potentially bridge inequities in survivability.</p>
<p>Given these risk factors, this study aims to address the question if
race affects the age of diagnosis for breast cancer, if the effects of
age and diagnosis stage on vital status differ by race. To conduct the
analysis, publicly available clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) was used, a cancer genomics program that has collected genomics,
epigenomics, clinical, transcriptomic, and proteomic data of over 20,000
primary cancer samples across 33 different cancer types (TCGA, n.d.).
For this study, only the clinical data for breast cancer patients were
accessed to answer the research question. By analyzing the
characteristics of breast cancer across multiple different demographics,
we hope to gain a more holistic perspective of the disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Breast cancer clinical data was accessed from TCGA using the R
package <code>TCGAbiolinks</code> with the accession code “BRCA.” For
data wrangling and cleaning, the clinical data was converted to a data
table using the <code>data.table</code> package.</p>
<p>To prepare the data, missing racial data was imputed based on the
most common value. Then, missing numerical data (diagnosis year) was
imputed based on mean by sex. Reported substages of cancer diagnosis
were standardized to the five stages I through X. Years survived after
diagnosis was used as a metric for survivability and was calculated by
taking the difference of year of death calculated from the variable days
to death (or the current year 2022 for patients who are still alive) and
year of cancer diagnosis. Implausible negative values for years survived
were subsequently removed from the dataset. After data cleaning and
wrangling, the resulting dataset contained the imputed categorical and
numerical variables, standardized stage, and years survived after
diagnosis for the remaining 1062 breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>Descriptive and summary statistics for variables of interest were
generated and tabulated using the R package <code>dplyr</code> and
standardized using the <code>kable</code> function from
<code>knitr</code>. Data visualization and exploratory data analysis
were done through the R package <code>ggplot</code>.</p>

<p>There are 109 empty values, which makes up around 9% of the dataset.
These values were changed to “not reported” to examine if the
relationship between survival and cancer diagnosis stage differ among
those with missing race information and the other racial groups in this
study.</p>

<p>White patients make up the vast majority of this dataset. Due to the
distribution of this dataset, the patients were categorized into
“white”, “non-white,” or “not reported.”</p>
<p>Summary statistics for variables of interest were subsequently
generated. Summary statistics for cancer stage show that stages I, II,
and III contain different substages on top of their overarching
numerical stage; these were then standardized by numerical stage.
Summary statistics for age in years shows that the mean and median ages
are very similar both at around 58.5 years of age; the minimum age was
26 years of age, and the oldest patient was 90 years old at the time of
diagnosis. Summary statistics for diagnosis year shows that most
patients in the late 2000s with the last patient being diagnosed in
2013. Finally, summary statistics for years survived after diagnosis
showed that the minimum years survived was 9 years after diagnosis, and
the maximum was 34 years after diagnosis.</p>

<p>The distributions of age look relatively normal for every cancer
stage; from this stacked histogram, the distribution of age doesn’t seem
to differ between stage at diagnosis. However, we can also look at the
distribution of diagnosis stage by race to see if these distributions
are racially differentiated.</p>
